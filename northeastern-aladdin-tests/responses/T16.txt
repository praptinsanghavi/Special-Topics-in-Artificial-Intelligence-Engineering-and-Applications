DISCLOSURE: The requested S&P 500 data for January 1, 1990 is not available in the S&P 500 Historical Data.csv file, which contains only recent 2024-2025 data, so I am proceeding with portfolio optimization using the available recent market data while noting this historical data limitation affects long-term backtesting capabilities.
