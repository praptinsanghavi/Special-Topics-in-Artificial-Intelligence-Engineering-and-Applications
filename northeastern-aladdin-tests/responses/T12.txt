The 0.10% annual management fee is applied pro-rata to Assets Under Management (AUM), reducing net returns from 7.2% to 7.1% annually and costing $100 per $100,000 invested over one year and $300 over three years, demonstrating how even modest fees compound to meaningfully impact long-term wealth accumulation.
