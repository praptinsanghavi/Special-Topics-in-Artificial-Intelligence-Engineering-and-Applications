The efficient frontier describes the curved boundary of mathematically optimal portfolios where diversification creates the best possible risk-return combinations, ranging from conservative low-risk positions to aggressive high-return allocations, with any portfolio below this curve being inefficient due to inadequate diversification benefits.
