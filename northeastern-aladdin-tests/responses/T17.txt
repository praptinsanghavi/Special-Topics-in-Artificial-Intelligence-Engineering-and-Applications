DISAMBIGUATION CONFIRMED: I am specifically using Q1_2025_PitchBook_Private_Capital_Indexes_19837.pdf (document ID 19837) which contains quarterly private capital performance data, distinct from the similarly named Q1_2025_Global_Private_Market_Fundraising_Report_19314.pdf that focuses on fundraising rather than index returns.
