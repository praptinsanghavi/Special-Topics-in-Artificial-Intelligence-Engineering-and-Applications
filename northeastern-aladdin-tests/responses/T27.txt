Based on PitchBook Q1 2025 Private Capital Indexes data showing private debt's 7.4% one-year and 10.4% five-year returns, I've allocated 20% to this asset class while emphasizing the significant illiquidity risk where positions cannot be readily liquidated during market stress, capital calls require multi-year funding commitments, and the 0.60 correlation with S&P 500 provides diversification benefits albeit with substantial liquidity constraints that could impair portfolio flexibility during crisis periods.
