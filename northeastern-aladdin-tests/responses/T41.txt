Based on Q1 2025 PitchBook Private Capital Indexes showing private equity at 8.4% and private debt at 7.4% one-year returns, I've structured a 30% private markets allocation (15% PE, 10% private debt, 5% real estate) balanced against 70% public markets, though this creates substantial illiquidity constraints requiring multi-year capital commitments.
