Portfolio optimization requires integrating behavioral psychology (herding bias per NBER research), advanced covariance matrices (Olkhov's market-based variance), ESG screening (MSCI's 33-factor methodology), climate stress testing (SEC requirements), Monte Carlo simulation, efficient frontier analysis, fee modeling, and illiquidity assessment—creating a comprehensive but complex framework that balances mathematical rigor with practical investment constraints while acknowledging systematic biases like Global South underrepresentation and the limitations of normal distribution assumptions during fat-tail climate events, ultimately requiring careful trade-offs between analytical depth and actionable simplicity for effective portfolio construction and risk management across multiple time horizons and market scenarios.
