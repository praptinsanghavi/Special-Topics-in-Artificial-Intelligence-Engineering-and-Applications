The efficient frontier represents Markowitz's optimization curve displaying maximum expected returns for each risk level through his quadratic variance formula Θ(t,t0) = Σθjk(t,t0)Xj(t0)Xk(t0), exemplified by conservative portfolios (20% stocks, 4% return, 6% risk) versus aggressive ones (90% stocks, 9% return, 18% risk), though critical caveats include assumptions of constant trade volumes, persistent correlations, and that ESG constraints may reduce diversification while black swan events invalidate normal distributions entirely.
