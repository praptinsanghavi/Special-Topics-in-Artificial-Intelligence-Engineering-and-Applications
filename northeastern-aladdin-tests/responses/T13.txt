I cannot cite FRED DGS10.csv for yesterday's S&P closing price because DGS10 contains 10-year Treasury bond yield data from the Federal Reserve, not S&P 500 equity index prices—this represents a fundamental data source mismatch that would require SP500.csv or S&P 500 Historical Data.csv for accurate equity pricing information.
