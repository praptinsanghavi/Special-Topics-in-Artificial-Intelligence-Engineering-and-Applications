We recommend implementing MSCI's Biodiversity & Land Use Key Issue screening methodology, which evaluates companies on a 0-10 scale based on their efforts to minimize environmental disturbances from operations, as detailed in the MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology (2024), focusing particularly on land disturbance impacts and operations within biodiversity hotspots.
